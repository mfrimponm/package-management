#As a good security practice, Nexus is not advised to run nexus service as a root user, 
# so create a new user called nexus and grant sudo access to manage nexus services as follows. 
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname jenkins
sudo useradd jenkins
# Grand sudo access to nexus user
sudo echo "jenkins ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/jenkins
